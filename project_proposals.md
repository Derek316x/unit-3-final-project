## The Problem 

**"An estimated 25–33% of students are struggling to achieve competency in handwriting."**
- Conti, G. “Handwriting Characteristics and the Prediction of Illegibility in Third and Fifth Grade Students.” Presented at Handwriting in the 21st Century?: An Educational Summit, Washington, D.C., January 23, 2012.

**"Illegible handwriting is a problem for a large number of children…it can affect [children] not only personally (their self-esteem), but also academically, and their careers in the future. So, it’s got a very long trajectory."**
- Dr. Gerry Conti, assistant professor of occupational therapy at Wayne State University

**"Manuscript handwriting instruction is only required until Grade 1, but fluency and automaticity in handwriting have been shown to develop well beyond then."**
- Graham, S., and Santangelo, T. “A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of Teaching Handwriting.” Presented at Handwriting in the 21st Century?: An Educational Summit, Washington, D.C., January 23, 2012.

## The Solution 

**[Doubt about the value of handwriting instruction] is similar to what happened with math as calculators and computers came into vogue…people wondered whether students needed to learn how to do math. The answer in both cases is absolutely “yes.” Writing is not obsolete.**
- Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators

Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  An app that will recognize your hand writing utilizing the iphone magnometer.  So that children and adults can perfect penmanship as well as asist in learning motor skills and new languages.
  *  Some sort of way to test accuracy.

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Think about the user stories you would frame your weeks around. *Your polished MVP (baseline features) should be ready to demo by Demo 1 on Thursday 11/17/2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.

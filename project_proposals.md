## The Problem 

"An estimated 25–33% of students are struggling to achieve competency in handwriting."
- Conti, G. “Handwriting Characteristics and the Prediction of Illegibility in Third and Fifth Grade Students.” Presented at Handwriting in the 21st Century?: An Educational Summit, Washington, D.C., January 23, 2012.

"Illegible handwriting is a problem for a large number of children…it can affect [children] not only personally (their
self-esteem), but also academically, and their careers in the future. So, it’s got a very long trajectory."
- Dr. Gerry Conti, assistant professor of occupational therapy at Wayne State University


In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   

## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Think about the user stories you would frame your weeks around. *Your polished MVP (baseline features) should be ready to demo by Demo 1 on Thursday 11/17/2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.

### Unit 3: Final Project

All apps:
  *  Will solve a relevant problem that serves an existing market
  *  Are technically complex and ambitious enough to highlight the skills you have gained
  *  Are fully functional and polished for presentation at Demo Day  

With that in mind, things to think about when ideating projects are the **technical complexity**, **design**, and **product**.

###Project Rubric
|Criteria|0-Does not meet expectations|1-Partially meets expectations|2-Meets expectations|3-Exceeds expectations|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Performance**|App has major bugs.  App hangs and/or crashes.|App has minor bugs and/or hangs briefly.|App has no bugs and doesn’t hang.|App runs as smoothly and cleanly as a default iOS app. |
|**UI Design**|Little to no effort has been put into aesthetics.  Design/layout between and within pages varies widely.|Some, but not all pages have consistent design.  Some elements are appealing, but others are not.|The app has a consistent look and feel.  Intentionality has been put into the color scheme and visuals.|The app is simple to use and elegant.  The aesthetic and design perfectly match the app’s function.|
|**UX Design**|The app is confusing and unintuitive.  Buttons' functions are unclear and navigating between screens is challenging.  Virtually no testing for UX.| Aspects of the app are sensible, but some remains confusing.  There has been little testing with users.|  App is layed out in a sensible format.  Navigating between and within screens is clear.|  UX design is fluid and intuitive.  Users are naturally driven to navigate the app correctly with no prior knowledge or outside help.| 
|**Presentation**|Group is unenthusiastic and does not increase interest in their app.  Pacing is much too fast or slow. Script and deck are crude or non-existant. |Group has some stage presence.  Pacing is slightly off. Script and deck are rudimentary, but communicate key information. |Group has solid stage presence.  Pacing is reasonable. Script and deck engage audience and showcase their app. |Group expertly commands the stage.  Pacing is perfectly geared to maximize impact. Deck is beautifully designed and supplements a well-crafted script for a fantastic presentation.|
|**Product**|Group does not explain who would use the app and what it does. Group does not present the problem their app will solve.|It is somewhat clear who would use the app and what it does.  Group presents either the problem or the solution, but not both.|Group clearly indicates who would use the app and what it does. Group presents both problem and solution. |Group clearly indicates who would use the app and why their app is specifially targeted towards the demographic that they picked. Group expertly explains the exact niche their app fills.|

###App requirements:
*  Overall product requirements
  - Technically complex
  - Compelling use case
  - Polished implementation (UI/UX)
  - Original product 
  - An engaging pitch that connects with the audience
*  Basic technical requirements 
  - Does not crash
  - Does not hang (little or no delay visible to the user)
  - Does not fail when internet connection is slow/unavaialable
  - Have a consistent look and feel visually across the app
  - Consistent with [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1)
  - Look great in both landscape and portrait
  - Have well-organized, high-quality code


### Tips & Ideas
*  Things that would impress:
  - Super cool library that other devs could use
  - Integration of complex APIs (e.g video, web services, etc...)
  - Awesome UI
  - Work with the OS in a more intimate way 
  - Advanced Separation of Concerns
*  Things to Avoid:
  -  Unusable: Good technical implementation, but does not consider the end user's interaction
  -  Non-function: Good UI, but does not actually incorporate the tools needed to be feature complete.
  -  Obvious: Solution can easily be found in tutorials or examples, copies an existing system tool, or simply strings together APIs.
  -  Not Useful: This app doesn’t have a clear purpose or solve a problem. 
*  Some sample project ideas:
  -  Weather + Calendar
  -  Poll app / trivia app 
  -  Really good photo journal app
  -  Really good note taking app

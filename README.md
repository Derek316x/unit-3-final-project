### Access Code 2.2 Final Project  
The goal of this final project is to utilize the technical and product skills youâ€™ve been gathering over the last 5 months to build a custom app with your teammates and showcase your abilities. 

All apps:
  *  Will solve a relevant problem that serves an existing market
  *  Are technically complex and ambitious enough to highlight the skills you have gained
  *  Are fully functional and polished for presentation at Demo Day  

With that in mind, things to think about when ideating projects are the **technical complexity**, **design**, and **product**.

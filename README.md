### Unit 3: Final Project

The goal of this final project is to utilize the technical and product skills you’ve been gathering over the last 5 months to build a custom app with your teammates and showcase your abilities. 

All apps:
  *  Will solve a relevant problem that serves an existing market
  *  Are technically complex and ambitious enough to highlight the skills you have gained
  *  Are fully functional and polished for presentation at Demo Day  

With that in mind, things to think about when ideating projects are the **technical complexity**, **design**, and **product**.

###Project Rubric
|Criteria|0-Does not meet expectations|1-Partially meets expectations|2-Meets expectations|3-Exceeds expectations|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Performance**|App has major bugs.  App hangs and/or crashes.|App has minor bugs and/or hangs briefly.|App has no bugs and doesn’t hang.|App runs as smoothly and cleanly as a default iOS app. |
|**Design**|The app is confusing, unintuitive and cluttered.  Does not work in both landscape and portrait.|Some, but not all pages have consistent design.  User experience is mixed.|The app has a consistent look and feel.  User experience is intuitive.|The app is simple to use and elegant.  The aesthetic and design perfectly match the app’s function.|
|**Presentation**|Group does not present problem that their app solves, is unenthusiastic and does not increase interest in their app.  Pacing is much too fast or slow.|Group presents either problem, or solution but not both.  Group has some stage presence.  Pacing is slightly off.|Group presents both a problem and their solution.  Group has solid stage presence.  Pacing is reasonable.|Group expertly explains the need their app fills.  Group expertly commands the stage.  Pacing is perfectly geared to maximize impact.|
|**Use Case**|Group does not explain who would use the app and what it does.|It is somewhat clear who would use the app and what it does.|Group clearly indicates who would use the app and what it does.|Group clearly indicates who would use the app and why their app is specifially targeted towards the demographic that they picked.|

### Tips & Ideas
*  Things that would impress:
  - Super cool library that other devs could use
  - Integration of complex APIs (e.g video, web services, etc...)
  - Awesome UI
  - Work with the OS in a more intimate way 
  - Advanced Separation of Concerns
*  Things to Avoid:
  -  Unusable: Good technical implementation, but does not consider the end user's interaction
  -  Non-function: Good UI, but does not actually incorporate the tools needed to be feature complete.
  -  Obvious: Solution can easily be found in tutorials or examples, copies an existing system tool, or simply strings together APIs.
  -  Not Useful: This app doesn’t have a clear purpose or solve a problem. 
*  Some sample project ideas:
  -  Weather + Calendar
  -  Poll app / trivia app 
  -  Really good photo journal app
  -  Really good note taking app
